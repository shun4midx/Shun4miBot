# This is code for my Shun4miBot!

It is written in D++, a C++ library for Discord, because I prefer to use C++. It is intended for personal use but if you find it useful, I don't mind you using it.

The C++ is very bad don't tell me, I know that-

I may also start working on my Shun4MIDI project thing here just because it's easier for me to deal with using a bot instead

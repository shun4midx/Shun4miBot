# This is code for my Shun4miBot!

## NOTICE: I WILL BE TEMPORARILY STOPING DEVING UNTIL JUNE 2025 WHEN THIS SEMESTER ENDS TO FOCUS ON MY STUDIES, WHICH OF COURSE EXTENDS TO THIS PROJECT AS WELL.

It is written in D++, a C++ library for Discord, because I prefer to use C++. It is intended for personal use but if you find it useful, I don't mind you using it.

Other than some miscellaneous things, there are a few main things Shun4miBot does:
 - **Japanese support!** (As of right now it is not open to the public, but I already have started to develop a Japanese to romaji converter. I will also work on developing typing in QWERTY and outputting Japanese)
 - **Traditional Chinese support!** (As of right now, full Zhuyin to Chinese support is complete! You can pretend to type on a Zhuyin keyboard when using QWERTY, and it will function just like a normal Zhuyin keyboard. I am working on converting from Chinese to Zhuyin now.)
 - Mini games between players (At the moment there is Tic-Tac-Toe, but I plan to make Connect 4 and Co-op Sudoku, or even my own game [eXOtended](https://github.com/shun4midx-offline/eXOtended) I came up with years ago)
 - Organize to-do lists (Or lists in general) separated for each user
 - Basic Math functions (Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logarithms, factorials, random integer generator)
 - A spinner and shuffler of a list. The spinner chooses an option at random and the shuffler shuffles a list randomly.

Feel free to suggest more ideas! I will also start working on my Shun4MIDI projects here in the future just because it's easier for me to deal with using a bot instead.
